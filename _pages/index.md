Thanks for your interest in the Tory Toolkit. The purpose of this microsite is to give you a general idea of what the
project is about, what we hope to accomplish, why we're doing it, and similar basic details.

If you're already sold and want to help out, [submit your details](/apply). Otherwise, read on.

## That's a terrible name.

Yep. It's a working title; it needs to be called _something_ while we're getting everything set up.

## Isn't it a bit political to call it the _Tory_ Toolkit?

Working title, like I said. But this _is_ a political project. We're going to provide resources to survive Tory rule.
They've been in power for nine years and it's their policies which make this kind of effort necessary. We see no need to
ignore that, and we see it as quite fair to remind people of it whenever they need support. Not the poor, not
immigrants, not Queer or BAME folk. The Tories.

## So what is it?

The big-picture idea is to create a collection of resources and tools which can be used to help people navigate the
neoliberal nightmare we've landed ourselves in. We're starting off by creating a replacement for the app Miriam Cates MP
previously created, which charged foodbanks Â£180 for the privilege of mitigating her own Party's policies. These
resources will be delivered by native mobile apps, as well as a 'bells and whistles' Web interface and a more basic Web
interface for constrained devices like smart TVs.

## You're kidding.

Nope.
[The Independent covered it](https://inews.co.uk/news/mp-cashing-foodbanks-launching-app-encourages-list-items-for-fee-1341830).

## Is that all?

No. The word 'toolkit' implies multiple tools, and that's the bigger picture. Once the foodbank functionality is up and
running, we'll be adding further functionality. Mutual aid networking, offline resource listings, guides to navigating
bureaucracies, and all sorts of things we haven't come up with yet.

## What stage is it at?

Very early. I tweeted about looking for development partners on Saturday 14 December at around 23:00, and it went wider
than I ever imagined. Currently we're gathering a list of people who are interested in helping out, and getting an idea
of their skillset. If you're interested, you can [submit your details too](/apply).

## Can I donate money?

No. Not right now, in any case. I don't want to accept any donations until we have at least a minimum viable product on
the Web and App Stores. If you want to do some good with your money right now, that's wonderful, and I would suggest
[donating to the Trussell Trust](https://www.trusselltrust.org/make-a-donation/) who are best placed to make the biggest
difference with it right now.

## Food banks need volunteers, not tech.

Yep! I'm not in a position to volunteer time, because I'm disabled. If you can help out at your local food bank
directly, there's little doubt that you'll do more good than you ever would working on this project, and I encourage you
to do so. If, like me, you would otherwise be able to offer zero support, let's work together and provide _nonzero_
support.

## Who are you?

I'm Dave. I'm a disabled nerd. My social details are over at [dave.io](https://dave.io).

## I've got more questions.

Great! Drop me an email to [dave@dave.io](mailto:dave@dave.io).
